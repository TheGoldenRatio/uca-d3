UCA Infographics and Visualizations in D3.js
=========

Creating interactive visualizations for UCA institutional research, student life, and recruitment purposes. Done with D3.js.

Hope to eventually create a portfolio that has:
- basic demographic info on yielded students (country, gender, age, etc.)
- information on admitted but not yielded students
- network graph of students who knew each other before enrollment
- intended majors
- grade distributions
- retention
- survey information

To run graphs with CSV files use: ` python -m http.server ` in directory to get past the cross origin requests error.

*Examples:*

<img src = "net.png" style="width:250px;">

<img src = "Country-D3.png" style="height:200px;">

<img src = "major.png" style="height:250px;">
