UCA Infographics and Visualizations in D3.js
=========
<img src = "Country-D3.png">

Creating interactive graphics and visualizations for UCA institutional research, student life, and recruitment purposes. Done with D3.js.

Hope to eventually create a portfolio that has:
- basic demographic info on yielded students (country, gender, age, etc.)
- information on admitted but not yielded students
- network graph of students who knew each other before enrollment
- intended majors
- grade distributions
- retention
- survey information
